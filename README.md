BetterPrepared is a web application which seeks to help improve the awareness of cyber security within a company. BetterPrepared accomplishes this through the process of training quizzes and ranking the 
comapany's over all cyber security awareness so that consumers and other companies can pick who they wish to work with based on security from attacks likes phishing and social engineering. 
BetterPrepared is an application that features both front end and back end development by using a database in order to store the data it uses to operate on the website.

BetterPrepared is written in JaveScript and TypeScript and utilizes the node.js, express.js, mongodb, and mongoose libraries. Better prepared does not publicize any information besides the company's overall 
security awareness score outside of the company itself.
